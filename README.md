# Summary
The analysis provides details that can be applied for the business proposal of starting a bicycle sharing program in Des Moines. Making bicycles available in high traffic areas with multiple sources of demand will help pinpoint the best locations to start this program in Des Moinse. For examples city areas where customers are commuters, tourists, and individuals needing to navigate a finite area that is more easily navigatable by bicycle as opposed to cars. Additional consideration are locations near to mass transit stations where mass transit brings individuals into the city, but then the bikes are handily available for local use. Since a majority of bicycles were checked out for less than 30 minutes, multiple prime locations that are within a 20-30 minute bicycle ride radius would be an ideal area to begin. A majority of the New York City users were male subscribers to the program, so additional advertising should be reviewed to promote the bicycle usage amongst female users and short term customers (e.g. visitors) to broaden the opportunities in Des Moines. Also, the details of a bicycle subscription program should be further reviewed to put into place. Beyond the analysis details, with the growing concerns on climate change and promotion of green transportation options, a bicycle sharing program for local use within high traffic city areas is an appealing option for a broad range of customers.

Two additional visualizations that can be performed include:

Visualization that further breaks down Gender and Birth Year for the number of trips taken to determine if there is a targeted user age range that are the predominant users of a bike sharing program. Or if a different type of bicycle is needed to appeal to broader age ranges.

Visualization that breaks down the number of rides taken per user type (i.e. Customer and Subscriber) during the week with a further overlay on Starting Location to understand if there are certain start locations that are more favored by Customers versus Subscribers. This can support understanding the supply of bikes needed in different areas during the week based on anticipated demand.
